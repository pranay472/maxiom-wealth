      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What is PPF (Public Provident Fund)?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">A Public Provident Fund (PPF) account is a savings account that offers Indian residents a tax-free and flexible way to save money. Not only contributions made to a PPF account are tax deductible, but under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961, the earnings on the account are also tax-free. The account can be used to save for retirement, children's education, or other expenses.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Contribution Limit</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Contributions to a PPF account must be made in multiples of ₹500 and can be as low as ₹500 per year. The maximum contribution that can be made in a year is ₹1,50,000. The minimum amount that must be maintained in the account is ₹500.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Tenure</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">The maturity period for a PPF account is 15 years, but the account can be extended for another five years after the maturity date. Partial withdrawals from a PPF account are allowed, but only after the account has been active for at least five years.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">How to open a PPF account?</h3>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">How is PPF calculated?</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">PPF interest is calculated using the formula: Interest = Principal × Rate × Time / 100. The interest is calculated yearly and credited at the end of each financial year. For example, a deposit of ₹1 lakh at 7% interest would earn ₹7,000 in interest after one year.</p>
